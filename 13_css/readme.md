1. Using an HTML skeleton and filling in paragraphs via Lorem ipsum generator
2. Continued to build the header and the navbar
3. With all the contents of the HTML down, we copy and pasted it thrice in order to build it three times with varying ways of styling -- internal style sheet, inline, and external style sheet
4. Through tagging each div class of each section as a different class, we could specify which elements we wanted to specifically affect in the class.
