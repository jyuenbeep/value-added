Read a list of occupations and the percentages of their occurences from a .csv file.
(Read it into a dictionary)
Then return a random occupation based on the randomness weight indicated by its percentage.

DISCO: Learned how to read .csv files.
QCC: NONE

PROCESS:
1. import necessary libaries (csv, random)
2. initialize the dictionary and the keys it contains (the column names of the .csv file)
3. open and read the .csv file as a .DictReader object
4. while reading it, transfer contents into the dictionary
5. make sure the percentages are converted to floats before being addeed
6. return a random occupation by using random.choice(), which employs weighted randomness
7. test to see if it is actually weighted randomness
