HOW THE WEBSERVER WORKS:

person -> https -> APACHE2

in apache2:
~/jyuen30 (your user)
- this is too much work to spin up a whole server for every project you do

you want to spin up a server whenever you want - that is where flask comes in:
- flask app lives behind apache

HTML FORMS (BACKEND):
- prebuilt input types 
- cgi-bin (common gateway interface) -> if apache was served files in it, it would run them
- flask more streamlined than cgi-bin; already has all the apparatuses needed

FRONTEND FRAMEWORKS:

terms:
- content delivery network (CDN): server

examples:
- bootstrap
- tailwind
- foundation

pros:
- adopt a framework and strap it onto your frontend
- makes your life easier

cons:
- your site might look like everyone else's
- limited set of tools
- you will be downloading all the components, but not even using all of it ---
  takes a longer time for the user to download
